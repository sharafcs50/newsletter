# Newsletter Subscription

## Try it out
You can try out the project [here](https://sleepy-ox-sunbonnet.cyclic.app/).

## Overview
I made this project to be able to add a newsletter feature to a website. This was a learning project to test how to use external APIs (Mailchimp API in this case).

## Features
1. Add a subscription page for users.
2. Users can register with their email address.
3. The email addresses directly get added to a Mailchimp list.
4. Further, the email addresses can be used to send periodic emails to subscribers of that list.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this project locally and navigate to the folder in bash.
2. Run `npm install` in your bash / command line.
3. Change the API details to your Mailchimp API (enter the detail of your respective Mailchimp Key in the `.env` file).

## Dependencies
1. body-parser
2. dotenv
3. express
4. request
